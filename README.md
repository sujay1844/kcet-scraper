A web scraper to check for updates in KCET-2022 website announcements section
I can't check every 10 minutes for the link to enter college course options
The KEA was supposed to post the link to the portal at 2022-10-14 01:00PM
Right now it is 2022-10-14 05:00PM

To run this,
- Install `python`
- Download and extract this project from [here](https://github.com/sujay1844/kcet-scraper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Open a terminal/cmd in `kcet-scraper-main` folder and run,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Then run the script,
```
python kcet-scraper.py
```
